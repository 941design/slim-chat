✔ Property: Determinism - identical file hashes are identical (6.087125ms)
✔ Property: Collision resistance - different content produces different hashes (2.204291ms)
✔ Property: Format compliance - hash is exactly 64 lowercase hex characters (1.110334ms)
✔ Property: Known value - empty file produces e4d909c290d0fb1ca068ffaddf22cbd0 (0.833708ms)
✔ Error handling: Non-existent file throws error (0.776709ms)
✔ Property: Large file handling - 15MB file completes without memory issues (57.982792ms)
✔ Property: Sensitivity - single byte change produces different hash (1.359334ms)
✔ Property: Random input - random content always produces valid hash (2.838208ms)
✔ Property: Stream integrity - streaming hash matches direct hash (0.89875ms)
✔ Property: File size variation - different file sizes produce valid hashes (4.463291ms)
